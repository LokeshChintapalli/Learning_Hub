This is a sample document for testing Module 2 functionality. 

The document summarization module should be able to process this text file and extract meaningful content. This text contains multiple paragraphs to test the chunking and processing capabilities.

Key features to test:
1. File upload and processing
2. Text extraction from files
3. Document storage in database
4. Basic API response structure

This sample document provides enough content to verify that the document processing pipeline is working correctly, even without the AI summarization due to quota limits.
